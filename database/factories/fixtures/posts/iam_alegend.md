# I Am Legend (2007)

---

Few mainstream blockbusters dare to spend so much time alone with their audience. ***I Am Legend***, directed by Francis Lawrence and led almost entirely by Will Smith, is a haunting post-apocalyptic experience that balances blockbuster spectacle with quiet, existential dread.

Set in a desolate, abandoned New York City, the film follows Dr. Robert Neville, a virologist who may be the last uninfected human alive after a man-made virus wipes out most of humanity. What begins as a survival story gradually evolves into something more introspective—an exploration of loneliness, purpose, and what it truly means to be “human” when society is gone.

Will Smith delivers one of the strongest performances of his career. Carrying the film largely on his own shoulders, he manages to make silence feel heavy and routine feel tragic. His interactions with mannequins, his dog Sam, and his own memories create an emotional core that elevates the film beyond standard genre fare.

That said, the movie isn’t without flaws. The CGI-dependent Darkseekers feel less convincing than the film’s grounded emotional moments, and the theatrical ending sparked debate among fans for years. Still, the atmosphere, themes, and central performance leave a lasting impression.
